# Agenda
- What are APIs?
    - define an interface to someone else's application
    - send requests (just like we do in the browser) and get data back
- High level HTTP and HTTP Verbs; How those relate to CRUD
    - HTTP is the protocol we use to make requests (deeper dive in Mod2)
    CRUD ---- HTTP 
    Create ---- POST (create something entirely new)
    *** youre gonna use this one a lot!!! *** Read ---- GET (just want to retrieve some info)
    Update ---- PUT / PATCH 
    Delete ---- DELETE (...self explanatory)

- Different Types of APIs
- Gem's you'll need
- Make requests in our little jeopardy-ish app. Action Items (AIs) below:
  - Initial request to seed categories 
  - Break & Review starter code for CLI
  - Request during CLI behavior to get category's questions
